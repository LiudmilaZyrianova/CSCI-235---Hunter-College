/* Input: the program will read an integer n, 8 < n < 20.
Your program should print \one" way of arranging n queens on an n*n chess board, and it must follow
the above rules: none of them share the same row, column, or diagonal (all diagonal not just the main
two ones).
• Again, the output must be a matrix (n * n). Each cell of the matrix must be 1 if there is a queen
there, and 0 otherwise.
